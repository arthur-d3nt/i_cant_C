# Python to C Machine Learning Conversion

## Project Overview

This project focuses on rewriting machine learning algorithms originally developed in Python, into the C programming language. The goal is to leverage C's performance advantages, such as faster execution speed and better memory management, to enhance the efficiency of these algorithms when deployed in production environments.

## Motivation

Python is widely recognized for its ease of use and extensive library support for machine learning. However, C offers superior performance characteristics that can be crucial for real-time applications. By converting Python code to C, we aim to provide a toolkit that combines Python's accessibility with C's performance benefits.

## Current Status

- **Phase 1: Setup and Initial Tests**
  - Establishing benchmarks for existing Python implementations.
  - Setting up a testing framework to compare results between Python and C versions.

- **Phase 2: Conversion of Algorithms**
  - Prioritizing commonly used machine learning algorithms for initial conversion.
  - Implementing algorithms in C and optimizing for performance.

- **Phase 3: Documentation and Tutorials**
  - Documenting each step of the conversion process and providing guides for C implementations.
  - Creating tutorials to help users transition from Python to C for machine learning tasks.
